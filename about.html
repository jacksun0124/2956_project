            I love to drive to various places in Ontario to take pictures especially in the summer when there are many parks. I love to travel and I love to travel to places that are beautiful and interesting.

        <div class="pb-2">
            I walk for an hour a day. Even in winter I walk for an hour outside. There are many discoveries while walking. Sometimes I see some rare animals. Once I rescued an Asian woman who was attacked by a man.

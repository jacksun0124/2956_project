        <h5>Photography</h5>
        <div>
            I just came to Canada and got a job taking pictures for a magazine. This job requires me to work one day a week. The photos I took at the time will be posted on the flyers and websites.

        <h5>Programming</h5>
        <div>
            I started learning programming after coming to Canada for a while and then got a programming related job. This job requires me to spend a lot of time making a website.
